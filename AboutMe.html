						<p class="smallerFont">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is David Perez and I have a number of different interests that all most likely tell the story of who I am in adult life. I love playing video games, watching movies/television, and enjoying my time with my family at home. All of these basically make me the kind of person that is easy to talk to, can relate to a number of different topics, and am always a friend first. I'll take a few moments to talk about each of these points below.<br><br>
							&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When it comes to enjoying my time off, it's almost always something in regards to enjoying a play session of my favorite game(s). I most especially enjoying sharing this time with my fiance because it's something that we both share and is a passion that led to our meeting and continues to serve as a bond even today.<br><br>
							&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If I'm not playing any video games then I'm probably taking it easy by watching some of the usual favorite shows such as The Walking Dead, Will & Grace, or any one of countless others. Suffice it to say, any trip to the movies is a sacred one and I relish the opportunity to catch some new flicks right there in the theater.<br><br>
							&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Most importantly, however, is the time I spend with my family because my home life is the most important above all else. I take my career choices and actions very seriously and I'm all business when it comes to work, but that's only possible because of the time I get to spend at home with my family. Without that precious time, I wouldn't be the man I am today and I look forward to spending all the more time as possible with them.<br><br>
							&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It is my sincere hope to be a successful player in the game of software development and programming because I feel this line of work ties in very well with my personality and thinking style. To be able to help solve problems or even just be able to contribute to regular maintenances for amazing services that we all enjoy in this age is a very exciting opportunity.
